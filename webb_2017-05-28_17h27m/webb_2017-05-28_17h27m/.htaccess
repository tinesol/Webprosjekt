# Classic PHP URL: http://wwww.domain.com/index.php?article=article-name&parameter=value
# Pretty URL: http://wwww.domain.com/article-name/value
# To get pretty URLs, we'll let PHP handle the URL processing by "disabling" it
# in Apache and redirect all requests to index.php (where we'll handle URLs manually).
# Otherwise, Apache would treat "article-name" like a folder name and keep looking 
# for the "value" subfolder and for an index file in this non-existent directory. 
# We'll turn the rewrite engine on and add a rewrite rule, where we tell it that we
# want to redirect everything except certain extensions to index.php.
# We commented out 'RewriteBase /' because we don't need it on localhost but some 
# production web servers (when we upload the site to the internet) won't work without it. 
# When you upload the completed website to a server, try it both ways and see what works.
# RewriteConds makes it so that no redirection is made when a file or folder exists.
# We made sure we only redirect when it's not a file URL by listing several of the most 
# common file extensions. Any other URL will be redirected to the index.
# Options +FollowSymlinks is required for redirect.
